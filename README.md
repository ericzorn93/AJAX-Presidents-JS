# AJAX-Presidents-JS

In this project we used AJAX and vanilla based JavaScript to take information from a JSON file that was being hosted from an outside source and input it into the DOM. The JavaScript being used was to constuct the table and also depend on the searches that were being conducted in the form. The JSON data is parsed and inputed into the table, which constructs and deconstructs as the user searches for certain presidential candidates. All data is based on presidential candidates along with their years of office and other information.
